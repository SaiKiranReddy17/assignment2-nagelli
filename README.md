> Newton's method, also known as Newton-Raphson, is an approach for finding the roots of nonlinear equations and is one of the most common root-finding algorithms due to its relative simplicity and speed. The root of a function is the point at which f(x)=0. Many equations have more than one root. Every real polynomial of odd degree has an odd number of real roots ("Zero of a function," 2016).

The input parameters of the algorithm consist of not only the function f(x) but also the initial approximation - some x0, with which the algorithm starts.

Suppose we have already calculated xi, calculate xi+1 as follows. Draw the tangent to the graph of the function f(x) at the point x=xi, and find the point of intersection of this tangent with the x-axis. xi+1 is set equal to the x-coordinate of the point found, and we repeat the whole process from the beginning.

It is not difficult to obtain the following formula:

xi+1=xi−f(xi)f′(xi)
It is intuitively clear that if the function f(x) is "good" (smooth), and xi is close enough to the root, then xi+1 will be even closer to the desired root.

The rate of convergence is quadratic, which, conditionally speaking, means that the number of exact digits in the approximate value xi doubles with each iteration.
